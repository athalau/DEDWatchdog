# DEDWatchdog
Simgears DED - Watchdog Prototype

The DEDWatchdog is trying to encounter a freeze / serial line disconnect bug in flight simulator hardware known as [Simgears DED](https://www.simgears.com/products/f16-ded-data-entry-display/). The (currently most recent) DED firmware (v1.0) / DEDHub Software (v0910) provided by the vendor is affected by a bug that, when triggered, "freezes" the display, i.e. no updates occur.

The DEDHub application is then unable to communicate with the DED on the serial port until you replug the USB cable, relaunch the DEDHub Application and let the DEDHUb rescan the available ports by manualy clicking a button in the app.

This bug triggers at least when using Simgears DED with [Falcon BMS](https://www.falcon-bms.com). I can't say whether or not this applies to [DCS](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/) too. I have no DCS installed, let alone the F16 model.

There is no official fix available as per this writing. They promised to release a new firmware / fix / workaround, tho. I decided to approach this on my own for educational purposes.
## Background
The Simgears DED seems to be based on a Raspberry Pi Pico according to the raw device output. It is connected via the USB port and registers itself as a serial device in the Windows Device Manager. Simgears made a custom firmware for the Pico. Installation procedure is just like any other Pi Pico flash procedure (hence, unplug, push bootsel button on the outside of the case, replug, put new image on the mounted disk, replug).

Communication from the [Falcon BMS](https://www.falcon-bms.com) client to the Simgears DED is done with [Simgears DEDHub](https://www.simgears.com/customer-area/),  a .Net based application. It's closed source and not available to the public. You need to have a customer account at simgears.com to download it.

The DEDHub attaches to the Falcon BMS shared memory segments. The shm is provided by Falcon BMS for the purpose of exchanging in-flight simulator data with external applications and devices. The DEDHub reads the data with the help of the F4SharedMem.dll library that is shipped with the DEDHub and can be found in the installation directory. The DEDHub attaches to the serial device that is connected on the USB port, too.

## Problem Description
For whatever reason, the .Net application throws the following error from time to time:

![Z6KaHRA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa83b25-d814-4556-9537-f8e978d7f8e2)


It's an "Unhandled Exception" message. Before you can click anything, you need to `OK` the modal that tells you to restart the DED. The `Details` button in the Exception reveals, that the DEDHub application lost the connection to the serial console:
```C#
System.IO.IOException: Ein an das System angeschlossenes Ger√§t funktioniert nicht.

   bei System.IO.Ports.InternalResources.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String str)
   bei System.IO.Ports.SerialStream.Dispose(Boolean disposing)
   bei System.IO.Stream.Close()
   bei System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.Dispose(Boolean disposing)
   bei System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.Close()
   bei DEDHub.MainForm.RescanNTimes()
   bei DEDHub.MainForm.checkBMSdataTimer_Fired(Object sender, EventArgs e)
   bei System.Windows.Forms.Timer.OnTick(EventArgs e)
   bei System.Windows.Forms.Timer.TimerNativeWindow.WndProc(Message& m)
   bei System.Windows.Forms.NativeWindow.Callback(IntPtr hWnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wparam, IntPtr lparam)
```

The root cause for the loss of connectivity remains unclear. The USB device is in state OK, does not have any error entries etc. From the Operating System perspective, the device is ready.

It seems like the bug is triggered with a much higher probability / more frequently (e.g. 5-15 minutes after you entered the 3d world) when having Falcon BMS running in background and the user doing stuff in other apps on the desktop (a browser, editor, any other 3rd-party app for example). But it happens too if you are flying around with your shiny F16. I've had crashes after 10ish minutes and experienced flights of 45mins that had no issue at all.

Besides having Falcon BMS in the background, I noticed a more frequent crash behavior if you stay in the 2d world of Falcon (e.g. the Briefing screen) for ages and then commit to the 3d world. Timeframes comparable wot the "having Falcon BMS running in the background.

### DEDHub normal operational status
This is the Simgears DEDHub Application UI. Bottom right reads the Simulator it connected to (Falcon BMS in the example) and bottom left reads that it's connected to the serial port of the DED device

### DEDHub error status
As soon as the exception is thrown, the DED Hub states that it's unable to find a suitable COM port / device like shown below

![1MSpWra](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0885924-4e85-4d8e-b24c-4a12aea88cf5)

Hitting the `Rescan` button does not help as long as you dont replug the USB device. This may be achived by physically replugging the cable or through software that is able to reset a specific USB port (pnputil or the like).

This is by no means a bug in Falcon BMS but either a bug in the DEDHub application or the Firmware on the USB device.

## WORKAROUND
Using the Watchdog client/server scripts will help to limit the clickdance - i.e. close the info popup and exception error window, replugging the USB cable, and restarting the DEDHub software. This includes enforcing hitting the Rescan button on the DEDHub GUI to re-establish the COM port connection. Restarting USB devices seems to be a task that needs real Administrator permisisons in windows, regardless whether pnptuil or other tools are used. The Watchdog Daemon therefor needs to run as Administrator.

The Watchdog Daemon and client is based on Windows Powershell, workflow as follows:

1. The Watchdog Daemon resets the USB port when it receives the magic command from the Watchdog Client
2. The Watchdog Client sends the magic command "RestartDED" to the Watchdog Server when it's executed
3. The Watchdog Client then forcibly kills the DED Hub, this kills all the Exception and Info dialog windows too, because they are DED Hub childs
3. The Watchdog Client starts the DED Hub and sends a ENTER keypress to the DED Hub to trigger the rescan as a human being would.
4. The Watchdog Client brings the Falcon BMS process back into the foreground

Note: I used Powershell because it should be available on every Windows client running Falcon BMS. I have very limited knowledge in Windows Powershell, so don't expect fancy or even beautyful code compliant to any paradigm :). I split the tasks into two scripts because I like the idea of least privilege. The only thing that is needed to be done as real Administrator is the reset of the USB port/device. It could have been done in one script that just does everything. But this would have been ended up running the DEDHub with Administrator privileges. Running everything unprivileged and raise permissions just for the USB reset call triggers UAC / asks for permisison to be called as Administrator, hence not an option in this case.

### Watchdog Daemon - DED_watchdog_server.ps1
Two variables need to be configured to match your setup.

- `$DEDDeviceId` is the unique USB Device ID of your Simgears DED.
- `$USBResetCmd` is the full path to the `RestartUsbPort.exe` (see Prerequesite below)

```
...
# this is the USB device ID of the Simgears DED. Change accordingly.
$DEDDeviceId = "USB\VID_2E8A&PID_000A\E66250D5C3268329"
# $USBResetCmd = "pnputil /restart-device"
$USBResetCmd = "C:\Users\r00t\Downloads\RestartUsbPort\x64\RestartUsbPort.exe"
...
```

#### Prerequesite
**Note:** the Watchdog needs an additional .exe from here:
 https://www.uwe-sieber.de/misc_tools_e.html (RestartUsbPort V1.2.1 - Restarts a USB port)

`RestartUsbPort.exe` is needed, because the Powershell build-in `pnputil /restart-device` mechanic seems to be unreliable for this task. It works the first time you execute, but then it refuses to reset again because it insists on rebooting to take effect. YMMV. Uwe Sieber, the author of RestatUsbPort, developed several useful tools. I recommend taking a look at his old-school software repo.

#### ExecutionPolicy switch
Default setting in windows for running powershell scripts seems to be: *disabled*. Hence, an error would be thrown if you simply execute this in a powershell like `powershell.exe <scriptname>`.

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6601ef6-9660-48f5-8680-f558ee7d0428)

If an error message like the above hits you, the execution of scripts is not allowed and you need to pass the `ExecutionPolicy` switch with the value `Bypass` on the command line., i.e. `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass <other options>... <script>`. This temporary bypasses the restriction to execute Powershell scripts for excactly this single call. This does not change your default setting, but lets you execute the script in question.

See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies for more information.

1. Create a shortcut pointing to `DED_watchdog_server.ps1`
2. Edit `Properties` > `Target` to be `powershell.exe -noexit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -file  <path_to_DEDWatchdog.ps1>`
3. tick the "Run As Administrator" checkbox in the properties of the shortcut

![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00fdc1fb-0093-4841-8e96-41fe5b15e298)

Alternatively right-click on the shortcut and select "Run As Administrator" manually everytime you launch the daemon. The watchdog server runs forever until you close the powersehll window it launched:

### Watchdog Client - DED_watchdog_client.ps1
One variable must be configured to match your setup. The default value will likely match as long as you did not customize the path when you installed the DEDHub.

- $DEDHubExecutable is the full path to the Simgears Hub executable.

```
# Location of the Simgears DED Hub Executable, change accordingly
$DEDHubExecutable = "C:\Program Files (x86)\SimGears\DEDHub\DEDHub.exe"
```

The Watchdog Client should be run with your logged in user, i.e. the one you are using to normally launch Falcon, DEDHub etc. You could create a shortcut like described above (bnut omit the "run as admin" part). This is fine for testing purposes.

However, you'll pretty sure don't want to click something while in flight. I use [FoxVox](https://foxster.itch.io/foxvox) to trigger the Watchdog Client on demand. I created a new voice command in the "Reset" command group  (part of the Falcon BMS library that can be downloaded there too). The command is named "DED", i.e. when I issue the voice command "RESET DED", the Watchdog Client gets executed:

![VSa6VmN](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4dd10c9-da3e-46e2-800f-dd4fa0d34756)

Note: I couldn't find a way to execute a command with arguments and parameters in FoxVox. But we need arguments as the .ps1 is not executable and pointing the "Run:" field in FoxVox to a windows shortcut does not work for reasons. I wrapped the complete command with a batchfile DED_watchdog_client.bat that contains:

```
C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -file E:\Repositories\DEDWatchdog\DED_watchdog_client.ps1
```

When you execute the Watchdog Client, the Watchdog Daemon window should have a message printed that looks similar to the following:

### FAMOUS LAST WORDS
- this is just a prototype
- there is no proper error handling implemented
- the solution helps to get the freeze situation solved without fiddling around with a USB cable, clicking five different buttons spread over three screens (happens to me always....)
- It limits your work to trigger the client script with <some technique>. I recommend [FoxVox](https://foxster.itch.io/). But of course there are many alternatives (Thrustmaster Target can trigger executables, Voice Attack can pretty sure too.
- pnputil fails with "need reboot", that's why I relied on an additonal 3rd-party .exe instead of built-in powershell features. But again, the tools provided by Uwe Sieber are useful, you might want to take a look regardless.
